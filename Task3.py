Problem 3 : "Word Scramble Game"   // search for how to scramble word in python what is the functions We need
Description:
Create a word scramble game where the program randomly scrambles a word and gives the player a set number of attempts to guess the original word.
Requirements:
The program should start by selecting a random word from a predefined list of words.
The selected word should be scrambled (characters shuffled in a random order).
Display the scramble	d word to the player and ask them to guess the original word.
The player should have 5 attempts to guess the word correctly.
For each incorrect guess, the player should be informed how many attempts they have left.
If the player guesses correctly within the attempts, display a congratulatory message.
If the player runs out of attempts, reveal the original word.
Handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., empty input).
Example Interaction:
Example Word:
Suppose the chosen word is "apple", which the program scrambles to "pleap".

Game Flow: 
Welcome to the Word Scramble Game!
Try to guess the original word from the scrambled word: pleap
pYou have 5 attempts.
